# Project 1: Stack and Queue Simulations (Rwanda Context)

## 👨‍💻 Practical Questions

### Stack – UR Canvas Simulation
- Student opens modules: Module 1 → Module 2 → Module 3
- Presses "Back" twice
- **Visible module:** Module 1

### Stack – BK Mobile App
- Stack: School Fees → Airtime → Electricity Bill
- **Undo Order (LIFO):**
  1. Electricity Bill
  2. Airtime
  3. School Fees

### Queue – RRA Tax Office
- 3 arrivals: A, B, C
- 1 served: A
- **Remaining queue:** B, C

### Queue – MTN SIM Replacement
- 4 requests: Client 1 → Client 2 → Client 3 → Client 4
- **First served:** Client 1

## 💡 Challenge Questions

### Stack-based Proverb Reversal
- Original: _"It always looks green on the other side"_
- Reversed: _"side other the on green looks always It"_
- **Why Stack?** LIFO helps reverse naturally.

### Queue-based Ticketing System (Amahoro Stadium)
- People join queue.
- Served in arrival order.
- **Problem with Stack:** Latest arrivals served first — unfair.

## 🧠 Reflection

### Stack Undo Logic
- Stack (LIFO) = Undo most recent.
- Queue would undo oldest — not logical.

### Queue in Real Life
- Queue (FIFO) = First come, first served.
- Ensures **fairness** and **order** in services like banks or hospitals.
